# Distributed Logging Application

## Overview

This project is a distributed logging application designed for robust and efficient log handling in a microservice-based architecture. The system is built with components for log generation, broadcasting, accumulation, and querying. It features real-time log processing with critical logs, scalable log storage, and a CLI for querying logs.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Microservices**:
   - **Origin Server**: Simulates the main server in a CDN.
   - **Cache**: Represents a caching layer.
   - **Router/Client**: Sends requests to the system.
   These microservices generate logs during their operation.

2. **Log Processing**:
   - **Kafka**: Acts as the message broker with two topics:
     - `logs`: For normal info logs processed via Fluentd.
     - `critical_logs`: For critical logs sent directly to the Kafka broker.
   - **Fluentd**: Accumulates and processes normal info logs.
   - **Elasticsearch DB**: Stores logs for querying.

3. **Server**:
   - Implements timeout functionality for log handling.
   - Consumes logs from Kafka and stores them in Elasticsearch.

4. **CLI**:
   - Enables querying of logs by type (`info`, `alerts`, or `all`) and allows specifying a limit on the number of logs fetched.

5. **Logger**:
   - Implemented in `logger.go`.
   - Generates and broadcasts logs across the system.

## Features

- **Real-time Logging**:
  - Logs generated by microservices are broadcast via Kafka.
  - Critical logs bypass Fluentd for immediate processing.

- **Scalable Storage**:
  - Logs are stored in Elasticsearch for efficient querying.

- **Querying**:
  - The CLI provides flexibility to search logs by category and limit.

- **Timeout Handling**:
  - Ensures reliable log storage even under high load.
